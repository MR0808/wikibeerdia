export const step1 = `The beer-making process begins with malting.
                                    Barley grains, the primary ingredient, are
                                    soaked in water to initiate germination.
                                    This phase activates enzymes essential for
                                    converting starches into fermentable sugars.
                                    Once germination reaches the desired level,
                                    the grains are dried in a kiln to halt
                                    further growth and preserve their enzymatic
                                    activity. The temperature and duration of
                                    drying influence the malt's flavor profile,
                                    ranging from light and sweet to dark and
                                    robust. Specialty malts may be roasted to
                                    add depth to certain beer styles.`;

export const step2 = `The malted barley is combined with hot water
                                    in a mash tun, creating a thick,
                                    porridge-like mixture. This process
                                    activates the enzymes within the malt,
                                    breaking down starches into simple sugars.
                                    The resulting sugary liquid, known as wort,
                                    is the foundation of beer. The mash
                                    temperature, water chemistry, and duration
                                    significantly influence the beer's body,
                                    sweetness, and overall profile.`;

export const step3 = `After mashing, the wort is separated from the spent grains in the lautering phase. This involves draining the mixture through a slotted false bottom in the lauter tun. To maximize sugar extraction, hot water is poured over the grain bed in a process called sparging. The collected wort is now a clear, sugary liquid ready for boiling. Spent grains are often repurposed as animal feed or composted to reduce waste.`;

export const step4 = `The wort is transferred to a large brew kettle and brought to a vigorous boil. Hops are added at specific intervals during this stage to contribute bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Boiling also sterilizes the wort, ensuring a clean environment for fermentation. The type and timing of hops additions play a critical role in determining the beer's characteristics. This process typically lasts 60-90 minutes and requires close monitoring.`;

export const step5 = `After boiling, the wort is rapidly cooled to a suitable temperature and transferred to a fermentation vessel. Yeast is introduced, initiating fermentation. During this crucial phase, yeast consumes the sugars in the wort, producing alcohol, carbon dioxide, and complex flavor compounds. Fermentation durations vary depending on the beer style, from several days for ales to weeks for lagers. Temperature control is critical to ensure consistent quality.`;

export const step6 = `After fermentation, the beer enters the conditioning phase, where it matures and refines its flavors. This process may occur in the same fermentation vessel, specialized tanks, or barrels. Barrel aging can impart additional flavors such as oak, vanilla, or whiskey notes, enhancing the beer's complexity. Conditioning smooths out flavors and ensures a balanced, polished final product.`;

export const step7 = `Before distribution, the beer undergoes filtration to remove any residual yeast, proteins, or sediment. Some breweries may skip or modify this step depending on the desired clarity and style. The filtered beer is then packaged in kegs, bottles, or cans. Many breweries add carbonation during this stage to ensure a perfect level of fizz. Rigorous quality control ensures that every batch meets the brewery's high standards.`;

export const step8 = `The culmination of the brewing process is enjoying the beer. Whether freshly poured at a brewery or paired with a meal, each sip reflects the dedication and expertise of the brewers. Pairing different beer styles with food enhances the experienceâ€”think stouts with chocolate desserts or IPAs with spicy dishes. Beer tastings and festivals are fantastic opportunities to discover new favorites and expand your palate.`;
